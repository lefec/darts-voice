Darts Scoreboard as a shiny app (WIP)

You can play individual games (with up to 3 players). You can set the number of legs to play from 1 to 9, choose between single and double out, and set the game mode to 301 or 501 points. You can also play a tournament with **unlimited** players (where each individual game must be a 1on1).

Winning a game loads a random gif.
